# craftinfo
Minecraft does not provide a way to see who's currently online on a server
at any given time, unless you log in. The craftinfo script parses
the minecraft server log incrementally and provides the result using a
gevent powered echoserver. 

Connections to this socket server can be made from different clients, like a
web application, a little desktop app or a mobile app. 

Anywho, for the time being this script only serves a personal need. You
can use it, but you might not find it usable.
